# QWTA
Quake Wars: Tactical Assault

This is just a mirror of my private git(and previously svn!) repository for QWTA.
There hasn't been active development here for some time, and there's unlikely to be again by me, but rather than just having a .zip file of source code, making the repository available publicly makes sense to me.

While I've got an MIT license on this, do please bear in mind that this is a game modification, and as such, all licensing beyond my own work belongs to the original developers, and I'm only able to grant or restrict whatever parts they've granted me.
Namely, from memory(and sorry if I've left anyone out): Splash Damage and Id Software
