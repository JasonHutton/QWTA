This is very improvised for the moment. Damn harddrive failure wiped out the SVN comments. So I'll start keeping notes in here. >.>


Dark Matter Cannon now has Quake 4-style Dark Matter Gun visuals and gravity pull behavior.
(Needs work still; use get bounds entities to grab pull targets, not a damagedef hack!. Pull through walls! Also don't detonate on impact with players/vehicles. Could stand 'dust suction' effects too?)

All vehicles may be airdropped in now.
Hog/Tormentor teleport-drop in. (Needs work still, to do proper allowed checks.) Probably get the heavy airlift for the titan and trojan maybe. Look into stopping parachute 'drift' too.

vehicle proficiency level 1(vehicle drops) given freely to all players

Jupiter Assault Tank added. (Using the Titan model still.) Fires BFG10k projectiles. Needs work still, remove the upper machinegun?
BFG10k projectiles need work still. Should target more than 8 targets.

vehicle teleport-drop option added.

Hyperblaster(Infantry, and Vehicle(Tormentor/Desecrator/Hog) versions.) now has Quake 4-style Nailgun behavior.
Needs work still: faster lockon, I think it still triggers the target lock alarm... It shouldn't, and flares should never work on it.
Non-instant-hit projectiles, slower firing rate, splash damage, lockons, higher damage. (Change sound effect to classic nailgun sound? What to use for the nailgun sound then?)

Hyperblaster cannot do headshots anymore. (Its detrimental to lockons and splash damage, to use it.)

Shogun and Nailgun basic behavior returned to ETQW v1.2 style behavior: fires slower but fires more pellets per shot, and can do damage farther away, lessenned spread, more damage.

Blood hit effects for gunshot wounds and knife stabs.
Corpses now bleed like living bodies when injured. (BaseETQW bugfix)

Removed minedots.
Removed "mine triggered" HUD warning.
Removed "anti-personell lock" HUD warning.
Removed basedefence anti-personell HUD warning.

Class number limits added. (Needs work still, for when conditions change, for bots in particular. Force players back to limbo when they're killed when on a class that has too many players on it... Get bots to switch too.)

Screen fades to red when unconscious.
Screen fades to black when dead. (Look into getting blurring working properly with these... Why does it disable one or the other when they're tinted+blurred but not when one or the other?)

all vehicle drops added to quickchat menus

"Hammer/Dark Matter Cannon" HUD warning text messages removed.

3rd Eye camera now updates its radar origin when moved(such as when attached to a vehicle), so it can be a mobile radar now. (BaseETQW bugfix.)

Vehicle spawnpoints within maps removed. You must vehicle drop a vehicle to get one.

Vehicle credit charge bar now always starts at 0 and charges up slowly. Vehicles have different costs. Vehicledrop quickchat menu reflects which vehicles are purchasable at which time. (Needs work, seems to have a slight loading lag when initially entering that menu. Precache somehow?)

Slight magog script fix to make dropping vehicles less glitchy.

strogg vehicle drops have a momentary bounciness disable on them. Might want to remove that as unneccessary with the teledrop?

Bots understand vehicle drops(In a retarded way, needs work.), and class number limits(Definitely needs more work too.).

pm_realisticMovement cvar added. Controls if strafejumping works or not.

raduspull functions need work...
new script functions added...

g_realisticDamage added.
Any damageDef can be automatically converted to use a different damageDef when g_realisticDamage is 1(It's a little kludgey but it works.), by creating a new damageDef with "realistic_" prepended to the base name. eg: "railgun_damage" becomes "realistic_railgun_damage". defs should also reference the appropriate damageDef with the appropriate keys: "dmg_damage" -> "dmg_realistic_damage". The prefix for keys is "dmg_realistic_".
Both steps are required for proper operation and future-safety, not just one.

damageDefs may now use the "inherit" key/value to inherit values from an existing damageDef. This simplifies realistic damageDefs.

A damageFilter is still required, and where the main changes of a realistic damageDef exist.

radar is now split into two distinct types. radar, and infrared detectors.
Radar cannot detect infantry.
Infrared can only detect infantry(but everything that uses it has radar too).
Psi Radar/GDF Radar: Radar only. Cannot detect infantry.
3rd Eye Camera: Radar + Infrared. Detects everything.
MCP: Radar + Infrared. Detects everything.
GDF Command Center/Strogg Domihub: Radar + Infrared. Detects everything.

in addition to vehicle credit, campaign rank is required in order to summon vehicles.

1. Proper hyperblaster visual/audio effects. (Fly sound?)
8. Crank the BFG's max targets up to around 16 or 32.
9. Get vehicle drops working as part of campaign rewards and such.
10. Get vehicle drops menu greying out unavailable things etc.
12. Give critical classes a slight class restriction boost.
12. See if being on a class-restriction-okay team and having the restriction go down, how it behaves immediately and on respawn... (Should probably let someone continue using it until death, then force them to the class menu?)
13. Get the DMC working nicer in general. (Gravity effects, blast, muzzleflash.)
15. Get realistic damages in place.
16. Nuclear Hammer (blinding flash + brief large-radius EMP)
17. Megatexture autodownload!
18. Get the "enemy x spotted!" chat displaying the actual name of the vehicle in text.
19. Optimize the 3rd eye to only update its radar when its pos has actually changed.
20. Add in 'blurry' effects when wounded, and fade-to-black when dead.
21. Use the heavy lift heli-plane-thing for some GDF vehicle drops.


Todo for v0.3 release:

1. Fix issue with DMG freezing in midair without detonation.
2. Fix cheats of teleport drop not checking for all known issues before dropping.
3. Hyperblaster should not give target lock or respond to flares. Faster lockon would be nice but nonessential. Turn off locational damage.
4. Class number limit improvements: force to limbo on death/force bots to switch on death when on a class with slots overused.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++5. Tie vehicle drop types to something. Campaign ranks? To stop the synced swarm-deploy of vehicles. (Aha, amount of charge allowed per rank!)
6. Get realistic damage defs setup, so we don't have to obliterate the nonreal damages.
7. Implement realistic damages for all weapons.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++8. Magog drops for heavy GDF vehicles.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++9. Radar restrictions.
10. Megatexture autodownload.
11. Linux version.
