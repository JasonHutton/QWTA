QWTA v0.3.2:
==========
CHANGES:
* Cvar g_useBaseETQW12Shotguns added.
  + Default 1.
  + Controls whether shotguns have a basic behaviour that follows the
    BaseETQW 1.2 behaviour model, or the BaseETQW 1.5 behaviour model.
  + Enable for BaseETQW 1.2 behaviour, disable for BaseETQW 1.5 behaviour.
  + Works in conjunction with g_realisticSpread and g_realisticDamage,
    so a variety of weapon behaviour combinations are possible.
  + Examples: 
    Default QWTA Shotguns:
    g_useBaseETQW12Shotguns 1; g_realisticDamage 1; g_realisticSpread 1
    BaseETQW 1.5 Shotguns:
    g_useBaseETQW12Shotguns 0; g_realisticDamage 0; g_realisticSpread 0
    BaseETQW 1.2 Shotguns: 
    g_useBaseETQW12Shotguns 1; g_realisticDamage 0; g_realisticSpread 0
* g_disableVehicleSpawns readded and redefaulted to 1.
* Cvar g_artilleryWarning added.
  + Default 0.
  + Enables or disables the printed warning text onscreen when the Hammer or
    Dark Matter Cannon is fired.
* Cvar g_useQuake4DarkMatter added.
  + Default 1.
  + Controls whether the Dark Matter Cannon fires ETQW-style Dark Matter
    projectiles, or Quake 4-style Dark Matter projectiles.
* Cvar g_useDeathFading added.
  + Default 1.
  + Controls whether fading effects are used when players are unconscious
    or killed.
* Vampire and Violator now have an alt fire. Instead of the airstrike
  proceeding from left to right from the thrower's position, the airstrike
  instead moves right to left, when alt fire is used.
* Cvar g_useReverseAirstrikes added.
  + Default 1.
  + Controls whether Vampire/Violator alt fire is permitted.

BUG FIXES:
* Jupiter tank no longer shows up as a Titan in obituaries when roadkilling.


QWTA v0.3.1:
==========
CHANGES:
* Cvar g_showPlayerArrows redefaulted to 2.
* Made some changes/improvements to the realistic damage fallback code.
* Player respawn timers reverted to be identical to BaseETQW.
  + Player feedback indicates BaseETQW gametypes are incompatible with
  + long respawn timers. A single-life last-man-standing gametype is planned
  + for a future QWTA release.
* Cvar g_useGibKills added.
  + Default 1.
  + Allows certain attacks(Currently only Covert/Infiltrator backstabs)
  + that don't normally instagib, to instagib so victims can't be revived.
* Cvar bot_useVehicleDrops added.
  + Default 0.
  + Enables/disables bots to attempt to call down new vehicles.
  + WARNING: See "Known Issues" section of the readme before enabling!
* Some technical changes to how the Jupiter is implemented.
* Cvar g_useClassLimits added.
  + Default 1.
  + Enables/disables the use of class limits.
* Force Escalation introduced as a concept.
  + Vehicles no longer have Rank requirements to be called in.
  + Force Escalation is an average XP count of all players on a server.
  + Vehicle Drops now use Force Escalation to determine when each vehicle
  + can be called in. Force Escalation reflects ongoing conflict in a battle,
  + and as it becomes more pitched, FE rises as central command takes further
  + notice of the hotspot, and lends more aid.
* Class limits will now dynamically adjust according to critical classes.
* Players using temporary class limit increases will be kicked out of their
  class upon death, after the temporary increase is removed.
* Cvar g_modVersion added. Reports the version of QWTA that is in use.
* Current version of QWTA is now displayed in the lower-left of the main menu.
  
BUG FIXES:
* Fixed Dark Matter Cannon having zero range blast radius in realistic mode.
* Fixed a variety of GDF GPMG and Gatling Gun vehicle weapon damage issues.
* Fixed negativePush flag not being copied over to inherited damageDefs.
* Fixed an unlikely potential crash by returning a BS value from a method.
* Fixed some minor Limbo GUI issues.
* Fixed issue with class limiter that was preventing bots from
  giving up their spot to a human player when on a dedicated server.
* Fixed issue with the class limiter that was allowing players to bypass it
  by switching teams.

* Spectator controls improved.
  + Attack: Next player.
  + AltAttack: Previous player.
  + Jump: Freefly spectator.
* Dark Matter Cannon now has Quake 4 Singleplayer-style Dark Matter Gun
  visual/audio effects and gravity pull behavior.

  + Projectile deals damage to nearby objects slowly.
  + Projectile hurls nearby objects away from detonation point when exploding.
  + Gravitational effects penetrate walls and other cover.
* Hammer has a limited EMP effect upon exploding.

* Vehicle drop charging now begins at zero and charges up from there.
* Vehicle drops take longer to charge than in BaseETQW.
* Vehicle drops have a campaign rank prerequisite before they can be dropped.
  + Generally, the more powerful the vehicle, the higher the rank required.
* Vehicle drops make use multiple types of deployment transport:
  + Jotun drops via parachute.
  + Magog drops via cable.
  + Strogg drops via orbital reentry.
  + Strogg drops via teleport.
* Bots have a rudimentary understanding of vehicle drops now.
  + They're pretty stupid about it, but they do call for vehicles sometimes.
* Jupiter Assault Tank added.
  + This is a heavy GDF tank that uses the BFG10k as a main cannon.
* BFG10k added. (Vehicle weapon only for now.)
  + Delay on firing.
  + Projectile fires energy beams at nearby targets(Up to 8).
  + Projectile detonates with high damage upon impact.
  + BFG Effect operates upon targets(Up to 8) that have line of sight
    between the detonation point, and the Jupiter tank, 0.5 seconds later.
* Hyperblaster now behaves more like the Quake 4 Singleplayer-style weapon.
  + Projectiles do not hit instantly.
  + Hyperblaster ROF is slower.
  + Splash damage occurs upon projectile impact.
  + Hyperblaster damage raised, but can no longer do headshots.
  + Hyperblaster scope can get rapid target locks upon any enemy unit.
  + Hyperblaster does not cause a lockon warning on target.

  + Damage falls off less over distance.
* Blood spurt effects occur when players or corpses are shot or stabbed.
* Class number limits added.
  + Class numbers restricted based upon class, and player count on server.
  + Bots understand class number limits.
* Screen fades to red when unconscious.
* Screen fades to black when fully killed.
  + This intentionally blocks the vision of the dead.
* Radar split into two distinct types: Radar and Infrared.
  + Radar cannot detect infantry.
  + Infrared can only detect infantry.
* Psi Radar/GDF Radar use only normal Radar.
* 3rd Eye Camera, MCP, and command centers, use both radar and infrared.
* Mxyzptlk's megatexture autodownload added.
* Cvar pm_realisticMovement added.
  + Default 1.
  + Enables/disables "realistic movement".
  + Enables/disables strafejumping.

  + GENERALLY, bullets do 3x normal damage and explosions do 2x normal,
    when firing upon infantry.
  + GENERALLY, vehicles take reduced damage from small arms fire.
* Cvar g_realisticSpread added.
  + Default 1.
  + Enables/disables "more realistic" weapon spreads.
  + GENERALLY, firing without aiming a weapon first is much more inaccurate.
  + Bots are aware of this, and will aim more often when enabled.
* Cvar bot_useStrafeJump redefaulted to 0.
  + For use with pm_realisticMovement. Bots will not attempt to strafejump.
* Cvar g_allowMineIcons redefaulted to 0.

  of other mods, including BaseETQW. (Easier to see on the server list.)
* Cvar g_ignorePersistentRanks added.
  + Default 1.
  + Allows QWTA to ignore persistent ranks for ingame purposes.
  + This cvar may only be set from the commandline.
  + This is important for the vehicle rank costs, to keep players from
  + having an unfair advantage.

BUG FIXES:
* Fixed BaseETQW bug: Corpses are now considered "flesh".
  + BaseETQW doesn't consider corpses to be flesh, so they wouldn't bleed.
* Fixed BaseETQW bug: 3rd Eye Camera now updates its radar origin when moved.
  + BaseETQW doesn't update the 3rd Eye's radar origin, making attaching it
    to vehicles or other moving objects, effectively useless for radar
    purposes. (The commandmap radar area would move, but the actual radar
    detection area would not.)
* Fixed BaseETQW bug: Removed cause of a console error message with Magogs.
  + A $null_entity item wasn't being checked for in some circumstances,
    causing error messages to sometimes be printed to console.
* Fixed BaseETQW bug: The "Volcano-Icarus Map Exploit" no longer works.
  + A serious exploit exists in BaseETQW 1.5, that has been fixed in QWTA.
  + Variations on maps other than Volcano are also addressed by this fix.
* Fixed BaseETQW bug: Autorecordings now stopped on map change.
  + Autorecordings will now stop on map change, then start again next map.
  + Fix provided by TimeStar.
