QWTA v0.3.4:
==========
CHANGES:
* More changes to the tactical nuke behaviours for the Hammer.
  + All changes rely on g_useNuclearHammer.
  + Explosion effect enhanced: Bigger flash and flare, more smoke, 
    bigger mushroom cloud, mushroom cloud lasts longer.
  + Hammer explosion's EMP effects increased based on player feedback.
  + Hammer explosion leaves an area of radioactivity for 20 seconds after
    the initial explosion. Blocking line of sight or entering a vehicle
    shields from these effects. Damage from radioactivity decreases
    the farther from ground zero you are.
  + Hammer explosions now cause a blinding flash, when nuclear. Hiding behind
    cover, fleeing the area to gain distance, or simply looking away from the
    detonation, reduce the effects of blinding.
* Cvar g_allowEMPFriendlyFire added.
  + Default 1.
  + Allows EMP effects to affect friendly units, for realism purposes.
* External ordinance on Anansi now visually in sync with ammo usage.
  + g_useVehicleAmmo needs to be on.
  + LAWs disappear as they're fired, and reappear as they're rearmed.
* Revert BFG10k back to automatic charging due to player feedback.
  + Kept the green HUD chargebar the manual BFG had.
  + Kept the green HUD chargebar cooldown time too.
* Some optimizations and improvements to the BFG's script.
* Second set of bind contexts for players added as part of a bugfix for 
  the bind contexts not working properly/being broken last release...
  The "strogg" and "gdf" bind contexts are now overridden by class-specific
  bind contexts. This means you can bind something to the gdf/strogg bind
  contexts, AND to the class-specific contexts(eg: "medic"), and for a class
  that has a class-specific context, that will be used. Or for a class without
  a class-specific context, the team context will be used. If neither is
  setup, the default context will be used, as usual.
  Class Context -> Team Context -> Default Context
  
BUG FIXES:
* Hammer explosions now cause blood splatters.
* Fixed BaseETQW bug: The "Sniper Rifle Reload Skip Exploit" no longer works.
  + A serious exploit exists in BaseETQW 1.5, that has been fixed in QWTA.
  + Also fixes the same issue for the Railgun.
* Fixed BaseETQW bug: Jump sounds added while carrying HE Charge.
* Fixed BaseETQW bug: Jump sounds added while carrying Health Pack.
* Fixed BaseETQW bug: Jump sounds added while carrying Ammo Pack.
* Fixed BaseETQW bug: Jump sound(jogging) added while carrying Binoculars.
* Fixed Anansi's LAWs having zero splash damage.
* Fixed a stupid issue with the bind contexts being broken in v0.3.3.
* The QWTA Limbo Menu tab has been fixed and re-added.

QWTA v0.3.3:
==========
CHANGES:
* Main menu now displays QWTA logo.
* Abaddon hovertank added. (WIP)
  + This is a specialized version of the Desecrator, mounting two new weapons.
  + Uses g_advancedVehicleDrops bitflag of 8192.
  + Costs 100 FE to request a drop of.
* Plasma Beam added. (Vehicle weapon only for now.)
  + A continuous-fire energy beam used by the Strogg for mining.
  + While highly damaging to vehicles and deployables, its effectiveness
    against living targets is low.
* Flamethrower added. (Vehicle weapon only for now.)
  + Spews a cone of flaming plasma across multiple targets, showering the
    ground beneath with sticky flamelets. Vehicles and deployables are
    immune to flame.
  + Be advised due to QWTA v0.3.3 being kind of a rush-patch, the flamethrower
    has significant issues(damage cone and flame graphics are desynchronized,
    water will not extinguish flames, and flame -graphics- penetrate 
    forcefields). The QWTA v0.4.0 flamethrower will correct these issues and 
    introduce more realistic flame physics.
* Players can now be lit on fire, burning and suffering damage.
* Cvar g_useQuake4Railgun added.
  + Default 1.
  + Controls whether the Railgun has penetration properties, allowing it to
    be fired through multiple targets(players and corpses only), or not.
* Cvar g_disableVehicleRespawns added.
  + Default 0.
  + Allows or disallows vehicles respawning after they're destroyed.
* Cvar g_useShieldAbsorber added.
  + Default 1.
  + Allows the use of the Tactical Shield's altfire, which re-absorbs
    shields that have been deployed.
* Matched the Quake4-style Hyperblaster's damages to the BaseETQW
  Hyperblaster's in response to player feedback. Changed the realistic
  damages for the Quake4-style Hyperblaster to be double for the splash
  damage, rather than triple.
* Improvements to the BFG10k's visual effects.
* The BFG10k is now charged manually.
  + Hold down fire to charge the BFG. If you release too early, the 
    BFG energies fizzle out impotently and you must wait for the weapon to
    cool down and reload before trying to fire it again.
  + If you charge the BFG10k too much, its energies will overload in a 
    massive internal detonation, destroying the Jupiter tank.
  + Charging the BFG properly takes practice. The difference between a
    properly charged projectile and an overload detonation is a 
    narrow window of opportunity.
  + Bots are kind of retarded with this new behaviour so far.
* Cvar pm_realisticMovement has had a setting added.
  + pm_realisticMovement may now be set to 2, as well.
  + pm_realisticMovement 2 is now the QWTA default setting.
  + This setting applies realistic movement physics to players, but not bots.
    This setting is a workaround for a flaw in ETQW's bot AAS pathing design 
    that requires maps to be recompiled to support certain changes in movement
    physics. While bots can use realistic physics too, their AI doesn't
    recognize it, leading to them doing very stupid things when trying to get
    from point A to point B. This setting works around that flaw.
* Cvar g_allowCrosshairs added.
  + Default 0.
  + Controls whether most(not all, notably Strogg scopes, sniper weapons'
    scopes, and most vehicles) crosshairs ingame are disabled.
    This is largely intended for realism purposes, as its assumed crosshairs
    for weapons aren't painted onto the personal HUDs GDF soldiers have,
    and in the case of the Strogg, that the crosshairs are not displayed
    unless the Strogg is looking through what's assumed to be a biotech
    interface for a gun camera. Ironsights are of course still available.
* Cvar g_allowHitBeep added.
  + Default 0.
  + Controls whether the hit feedback beep and flash are permitted.
* Cvar g_useBaseETQW12SniperTrail added.
  + Default 1.
  + Sets QWTA to use the BaseETQW 1.2 Sniper Rifle trail/tracer effect.
    This effect is more subtle than the BaseETQW 1.5 effect, and harder
    to spot.
* Blood and gore effects improved considerably.
* Cvar g_realisticDamage removed.
* Cvar g_realisticSpread removed.
* Cvar g_useRealisticWeapons added.
  + Default 1.
  + Consolidates g_realisticDamage and g_realisticSpread as well as other new
    features into one cvar. Generally, GDF weapons have a higher rate of fire
    than in BaseETQW. Realistic damages for these weapons lowered slightly,
    to make up for the ability to put more lead on target. Strogg weapons
    remain slow-firing and higher-damage, but their accuracies have also
    improved.
* Bind contexts for Jupiter, Abaddon, Strogg team, and GDF team, added.
  + Jupiter: "g_bind_context_jupiter"
  + Abaddon: "g_bind_context_abaddon"
  + Strogg: "strogg" (Includes all the Strogg classes.)
  + GDF: "gdf" (Includes all the GDF classes.)
  + Jupiter and Abaddon are included as part of the bind context "vehicle" too
* Cvar g_useVehicleAmmo added,
  + Default 1.
  + Controls whether vehicle weapons consume depletable ammunition or if they
    have an infinite supply of munitions.
* Script memory limits generally doubled from BaseETQW.
* Tweaked the FE Prerequisites of the Hog and Desecrator in response to player
  feedback.
  + Hog: 30FE -> 25FE
  + Desecrator: 40FE -> 45FE

BUG FIXES:
* Fixed Quake4-style Hyperblaster's projectiles doing triple damage to
  vehicles and deployables.
* Adjusted the sound shaders of the BFG10k and the DMC to more appropriate
  volumes and distances.
* Fixed a bug with class limit autoadjuster using GDF values for Strogg team.
* Fixed a bug which was causing Flyer Drones to emit warning messages.
* Some rudimentary fixes to vehicle drop permissions for land/sea deployments.


QWTA v0.3.2:
==========
CHANGES:
* Cvar g_useBaseETQW12Shotguns added.
  + Default 1.
  + Controls whether shotguns have a basic behaviour that follows the
    BaseETQW 1.2 behaviour model, or the BaseETQW 1.5 behaviour model.
  + Enable for BaseETQW 1.2 behaviour, disable for BaseETQW 1.5 behaviour.
  + Works in conjunction with g_realisticSpread and g_realisticDamage,
    so a variety of weapon behaviour combinations are possible.
  + Examples: 
    Default QWTA Shotguns:
    g_useBaseETQW12Shotguns 1; g_realisticDamage 1; g_realisticSpread 1
    BaseETQW 1.5 Shotguns:
    g_useBaseETQW12Shotguns 0; g_realisticDamage 0; g_realisticSpread 0
    BaseETQW 1.2 Shotguns: 
    g_useBaseETQW12Shotguns 1; g_realisticDamage 0; g_realisticSpread 0
* g_disableVehicleSpawns readded and redefaulted to 1.
* Cvar g_artilleryWarning added.
  + Default 0.
  + Enables or disables the printed warning text onscreen when the Hammer or
    Dark Matter Cannon is fired.
* Cvar g_useQuake4DarkMatter added.
  + Default 1.
  + Controls whether the Dark Matter Cannon fires ETQW-style Dark Matter
    projectiles, or Quake 4-style Dark Matter projectiles.
* Cvar g_useDeathFading added.
  + Default 1.
  + Controls whether fading effects are used when players are unconscious
    or killed.
* Vampire and Violator now have an alt fire. Instead of the airstrike
  proceeding from left to right from the thrower's position, the airstrike
  instead moves right to left, when alt fire is used.
* Cvar g_useReverseAirstrikes added.
  + Default 1.
  + Controls whether Vampire/Violator alt fire is permitted.
* Jupiter tank's minigun is no longer usable.
* Jupiter tank can no longer accelerate using overdrive.
* Added tooltip upon entering the Jupiter tank.
* Force Escalation is now rounded down.
* Cvar g_useNuclearHammer added.
  + Default 1.
  + Controls whether the Hammer and SSM missiles behave more like tactical
    nukes. At the moment, this is just their EMP effects.
* Bots are now aware(only somewhat on easy difficulties) that shooting at
  heavy vehicles with light weapons does not accomplish much, when realistic
  damages are enabled.
* Cvar g_useQuake4Hyperblaster added.
  + Default 1.
  + Controls whether the Hyperblaster fires ETQW-style hitscan bullets, or
    Quake 4-Nailgun-style mini-plasma shells that explode on impact.
  + Works in conjunction with g_realisticSpread and g_realisticDamage.
* Hyperblaster's homing abilities changed to be more corrective to aim,
  less predictive.
* Cvar g_advancedVehicleDrops added.
  + Default: -1
  + A bitfield value that controls which vehicles may be dropped.
    Setting to a negative number enables all vehicle drops. Setting to
    zero disables all vehicle drops. Individual vehicles can be enabled
    as follows:
    Husky:		1		Platypus:		2
    Armadillo:		4		Trojan:			8
    Bumblebee:		16		Titan:			32
    Anansi:		64		Icarus:			128
    Hog:		256		Desecrator:		512
    Cyclops:		1024		Tormentor:		2048
    Jupiter:		4096
  + Bitfields, for the uninitiated, can be combined by adding the numbers
    corresponding to the desired values. For example:
    Husky(1) + Icarus(128) = 129
    Husky(1) + Icarus(128) + Platypus(2) + Armadillo(4) + Hog(256) = 391
    Anansi(64) + Tormentor(2048) = 2112
    All vehicles except Jupiter = 4095
* Cvar g_useSpecificRadar added.
  + Default 1.
  + Controls whether radar is prevented from detecting players.
  + 3rd Eye Camera, the MCP radar, and command-post radar are considered
    to include Infrared detection equipment, so are exempt from this setting.
* Cvar g_vehicleDropsUseFE added.
  + Default 1.
  + Controls whether Force Escalation is used as a requirement of 
    vehicle drops. It's recommended to leave this on when heavier vehicles
    are allowed to be dropped.
* Cvar g_useBaseETQWVehicleCredits added.
  + Default 0.
  + Controls whether the Husky and Icarus's BaseETQW vehicle credit costs
    are used, or the more expensive QWTA defaults.
* Cvar g_useBaseETQWProficiencies added.
  + Default 0.
  + Prevents players from being given free Vehicle Drop rewards.
* Cvar g_useBaseETQWVehicleCharge added.
  + Default 0.
  + Controls whether the vehicle credit charge timer uses BaseETQW timing.
* Cvar bot_useVehicleDrops redefaulted to 1.
  + The Island crash bug appears to be fixed. Bots now use vehicle drops.
* Hyperblaster effects changed to make their explosive nature more apparent.
* Improved blood and gore effects slightly.
* Cvar g_vehicleSpawnsUseFE added.
  + Default 1.
  + Controls if regular vehicle spawning restricts which vehicles spawn,
    when, based upon Force Escalation.
* Cvar g_ignorePersistentRanks redefaulted to 0.

BUG FIXES:
* Jupiter tank no longer shows up as a Titan in obituaries when roadkilling.
* Optimized loading of vehicle drops.
  This incidentally appears to fix the Island crash bug.
* Removed an unneccessary attempt at minimizing vehicle bounce when dropped.
  Was causing crashes some some cases.


QWTA v0.3.1:
==========
CHANGES:
* Cvar g_showPlayerArrows redefaulted to 2.
* Made some changes/improvements to the realistic damage fallback code.
* Player respawn timers reverted to be identical to BaseETQW.
  + Player feedback indicates BaseETQW gametypes are incompatible with
  + long respawn timers. A single-life last-man-standing gametype is planned
  + for a future QWTA release.
* Cvar g_useGibKills added.
  + Default 1.
  + Allows certain attacks(Currently only Covert/Infiltrator backstabs)
  + that don't normally instagib, to instagib so victims can't be revived.
* Cvar bot_useVehicleDrops added.
  + Default 0.
  + Enables/disables bots to attempt to call down new vehicles.
  + WARNING: See "Known Issues" section of the readme before enabling!
* Some technical changes to how the Jupiter is implemented.
* Cvar g_useClassLimits added.
  + Default 1.
  + Enables/disables the use of class limits.
* Force Escalation introduced as a concept.
  + Vehicles no longer have Rank requirements to be called in.
  + Force Escalation is an average XP count of all players on a server.
  + Vehicle Drops now use Force Escalation to determine when each vehicle
  + can be called in. Force Escalation reflects ongoing conflict in a battle,
  + and as it becomes more pitched, FE rises as central command takes further
  + notice of the hotspot, and lends more aid.
* Class limits will now dynamically adjust according to critical classes.
* Players using temporary class limit increases will be kicked out of their
  class upon death, after the temporary increase is removed.
* Cvar g_modVersion added. Reports the version of QWTA that is in use.
* Current version of QWTA is now displayed in the lower-left of the main menu.
  
BUG FIXES:
* Fixed Dark Matter Cannon having zero range blast radius in realistic mode.
* Fixed a variety of GDF GPMG and Gatling Gun vehicle weapon damage issues.
* Fixed negativePush flag not being copied over to inherited damageDefs.
* Fixed an unlikely potential crash by returning a BS value from a method.
* Fixed some minor Limbo GUI issues.
* Fixed issue with class limiter that was preventing bots from
  giving up their spot to a human player when on a dedicated server.
* Fixed issue with the class limiter that was allowing players to bypass it
  by switching teams.


QWTA v0.3:
==========
CHANGES:
* Threw out all previous changes and restarted QWTA development from scratch.
* Previous versions of QWTA: v0.21, v0.2, v0.11, and v0.1 not built off of.
* QWTA is now compatible with ETQW v1.5.
* Spectator controls improved.
  + Attack: Next player.
  + AltAttack: Previous player.
  + Jump: Freefly spectator.
* Dark Matter Cannon now has Quake 4 Singleplayer-style Dark Matter Gun
  visual/audio effects and gravity pull behavior.
  + Projectile pulls nearby objects(players, vehicles) towards it.
  + Projectile deals damage to nearby objects slowly.
  + Projectile hurls nearby objects away from detonation point when exploding.
  + Gravitational effects penetrate walls and other cover.
* Hammer has a limited EMP effect upon exploding.
* Hammer and Dark Matter Cannon warning text upon firing removed.
* Player respawns now take twice the length of time they do in BaseETQW.
* Vehicles no longer spawn into the map, they must be called in by players
  via vehicle drop. (Use the quickchat menu->vehicles->vehicle drops.)
* The ability to use vehicle drops is given freely to all players, however:
* Vehicle drop charging now begins at zero and charges up from there.
* Vehicle drops take longer to charge than in BaseETQW.
* Vehicle drops have a campaign rank prerequisite before they can be dropped.
  + Generally, the more powerful the vehicle, the higher the rank required.
* Vehicle drops make use multiple types of deployment transport:
  + Jotun drops via parachute.
  + Magog drops via cable.
  + Strogg drops via orbital reentry.
  + Strogg drops via teleport.
* Bots have a rudimentary understanding of vehicle drops now.
  + They're pretty stupid about it, but they do call for vehicles sometimes.
* Jupiter Assault Tank added.
  + This is a heavy GDF tank that uses the BFG10k as a main cannon.
* BFG10k added. (Vehicle weapon only for now.)
  + Delay on firing.
  + Projectile fires energy beams at nearby targets(Up to 8).
  + Projectile detonates with high damage upon impact.
  + BFG Effect operates upon targets(Up to 8) that have line of sight
    between the detonation point, and the Jupiter tank, 0.5 seconds later.
* Hyperblaster now behaves more like the Quake 4 Singleplayer-style weapon.
  + Projectiles do not hit instantly.
  + Hyperblaster ROF is slower.
  + Splash damage occurs upon projectile impact.
  + Hyperblaster damage raised, but can no longer do headshots.
  + Hyperblaster scope can get rapid target locks upon any enemy unit.
  + Hyperblaster does not cause a lockon warning on target.
  + Hyperblaster projectiles cannot be decoyed away with flares.
* Shotgun and Nailgun core behavior returned to ETQW v1.2 style behavior:
  + ROF slower.
  + More pellets per shot.
  + Smaller spread.
  + More damage.
  + Damage falls off less over distance.
* Blood spurt effects occur when players or corpses are shot or stabbed.
* Class number limits added.
  + Class numbers restricted based upon class, and player count on server.
  + Bots understand class number limits.
* Screen fades to red when unconscious.
* Screen fades to black when fully killed.
  + This intentionally blocks the vision of the dead.
* Radar split into two distinct types: Radar and Infrared.
  + Radar cannot detect infantry.
  + Infrared can only detect infantry.
* Psi Radar/GDF Radar use only normal Radar.
* 3rd Eye Camera, MCP, and command centers, use both radar and infrared.
* Mxyzptlk's megatexture autodownload added.
* Cvar pm_realisticMovement added.
  + Default 1.
  + Enables/disables "realistic movement".
  + Enables/disables strafejumping.
* Cvar g_realisticDamage added.
  + Default 1.
  + Enables/disables higher, "more realistic" weapon damages.
  + GENERALLY, bullets do 3x normal damage and explosions do 2x normal,
    when firing upon infantry.
  + GENERALLY, vehicles take reduced damage from small arms fire.
* Cvar g_realisticSpread added.
  + Default 1.
  + Enables/disables "more realistic" weapon spreads.
  + GENERALLY, firing without aiming a weapon first is much more inaccurate.
  + Bots are aware of this, and will aim more often when enabled.
* Cvar bot_useStrafeJump redefaulted to 0.
  + For use with pm_realisticMovement. Bots will not attempt to strafejump.
* Cvar g_allowMineIcons redefaulted to 0.
  + Disables minedots by default, serverside.
* Cvar g_allowMineTriggerWarning added.
  + Default 0.
  + Enables/disables mine trigger warnings, serverside.
* Cvar g_allowAPTWarning added.
  + Default 0.
  + Enables/disables APT and BDT(APT mode only) HUD warnings, serverside.
* Autodetects the gametype other QWTA servers are using, hides the gametype
  of other mods, including BaseETQW. (Easier to see on the server list.)
* Cvar g_ignorePersistentRanks added.
  + Default 1.
  + Allows QWTA to ignore persistent ranks for ingame purposes.
  + This cvar may only be set from the commandline.
  + This is important for the vehicle rank costs, to keep players from
  + having an unfair advantage.

BUG FIXES:
* Fixed BaseETQW bug: Corpses are now considered "flesh".
  + BaseETQW doesn't consider corpses to be flesh, so they wouldn't bleed.
* Fixed BaseETQW bug: 3rd Eye Camera now updates its radar origin when moved.
  + BaseETQW doesn't update the 3rd Eye's radar origin, making attaching it
    to vehicles or other moving objects, effectively useless for radar
    purposes. (The commandmap radar area would move, but the actual radar
    detection area would not.)
* Fixed BaseETQW bug: Removed cause of a console error message with Magogs.
  + A $null_entity item wasn't being checked for in some circumstances,
    causing error messages to sometimes be printed to console.
* Fixed BaseETQW bug: The "Volcano-Icarus Map Exploit" no longer works.
  + A serious exploit exists in BaseETQW 1.5, that has been fixed in QWTA.
  + Variations on maps other than Volcano are also addressed by this fix.
* Fixed BaseETQW bug: Autorecordings now stopped on map change.
  + Autorecordings will now stop on map change, then start again next map.
  + Fix provided by TimeStar.
