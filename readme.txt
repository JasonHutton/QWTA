1. About
================================
QWTA is a straightforward mod in intention; it's intended to tweak the core 
gameplay aspects of Enemy Territory: Quake Wars, to create a more believable,
more realistic experience, that plays more like a serious science fiction 
movie, than an arcade game.

QWTA's secondary objective is to bring more classic Quake 2/4 features to
realization in ETQW, and to embrace new developments that fit within the broad
ETQW/Quake 2/Quake 4/Earth-Stroggos war theme.
Generally, QWTA is assuming ETQW is set before Quake 2, and will attempt to
mix Quake 2 and Quake 4 technology, characters, etc, with that in mind,
in addition to attempting to extrapolate modern technology to ETQW's level.

QWTA takes a lot of its gameplay inspiration from a few random(I'm afraid I 
don't recall the names.) realism mods that have popped up for the 
Call of Duty series of games, and the goal is to get something as an 
end-result that plays similarly to those, but in the futuristic setting of 
the Earth-Stroggos war.

At present, QWTA is intended to function with any base ETQW map, without a 
hitch, and it's hoped that this will continue to be the case through QWTA's 
development: while QWTA would certainly welcome QWTA-intended maps, they're 
not something that's felt should be required.

As a player, the preview video footage that was published before ETQW itself
was released, spoke to me of a gritty, tactical, bloody sort of game, 
involving a lot of thinking and strategy, rather than the run-and-gun-fest 
that the released version of BaseETQW is. To that end, QWTA tries to stay 
true to the perceived feeling behind some of that original footage, and the 
impression it had on a lot of people.

3. Installation
================================
First off, you'll want to unzip the QWTA release zip file into your 
ETQW folder. You should end up with a /qwta/ folder alongside your /base/ 
folder, inside your ETQW folder. 

Next, simply start ETQW as normal, and use the Mod Menu to select QWTA.
Alternatively, you can start ETQW with the commandline: +set fs_game qwta

Finally, find yourself a server that's running QWTA, and give things a try. :)
